						<li> <span class="yr">1880</span>, After attaining the patent for the light bulb, he founded the Edison Illuminating Company, with a motive of delivering electricity to provide power and light the cities of the world.

The other inventions that he worked upon during this time were fluoroscopy, two-way telegraph, kinetoscope, and so on. He then initiated an industrial research laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, which formed the base of the primary research laboratory for the Edison lighting companies.</li>
						<li> <span class="yr">1891</span>, Working with William K.L. Dickson, Edison succeeded in constructing a working motion picture camera, the Kinetograph, and a viewing instrument, the Kinetoscope, which he patented.</li>

						<li> <span class="yr">1915</span>, The federal government asked Edison to head the Naval Consulting Board, which examined inventions submitted for military use. Edison worked on several problems, including submarine detectors and gun location techniques.</li>
